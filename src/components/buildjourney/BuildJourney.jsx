The combination of detailed spec sheets, weekly build photos, video walkthroughs, and live FaceTime access means you have more visibility into your Deluxe build than you'd typically get visiting a showroom once. Our 5.0 Google rating reflects how comfortable customers feel with this process. Whether you're visiting us in person or looking to buy a caravan online Australia-wide, our Build Journey gives you complete confidence throughout the build." },
  { q: "How long does a build take?", a: "Build times vary by model and current slot availability. Typically 8–14 weeks from deposit to handover. We'll give you a realistic build window in writing before you place a deposit — no vague promises." },
  { q: "Can I change my mind after I've placed a deposit?", a: "Yes — specification changes are accepted through to the framing stage and sometimes beyond. We've accommodated significant changes mid-build. Changes may affect pricing if they involve upgrades, which we'll communicate clearly before proceeding." },
  { q: "Do you deliver interstate?", a: "Yes. We can arrange delivery of your completed van to anywhere in Australia. Interstate buyers also receive a full video handover package so you understand every system before you hit the road. Many customers also fly to Melbourne for factory collection — we're happy to recommend where to stay." },
  { q: "What does your warranty actually cover?", a: "Your 3-year structural warranty covers the chassis, frame, walls, roof and floor. Your 1-year manufacturer warranty covers all fittings and inclusions. Both are serviced through our nationwide authorised repairer network — you don't have to come back to Melbourne. Appliances carry their own manufacturer warranties (Dometic, Thetford, AL-KO etc.) which we'll help you navigate." },
  { q: "Will my car tow a Deluxe van?", a: "This is one of the first things we check. Tell us your tow vehicle make, model and year and we'll confirm compatibility across our range before you go any further. We'd rather tell you the honest answer early than have you buy the wrong van." },
